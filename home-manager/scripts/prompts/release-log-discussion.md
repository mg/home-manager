# Release Log Script Discussion

## 1. Original User Prompt
> Build a python script named release-log.py to do the following:
>
> - Look at the git log in current git repository.
> - Look for commits tagged with a version number.
> - Build a list of commits between the last two tagged commits.
> - Build a list of pull requests for every commit, use the origin url.
> - Create a list to hold the following item: jira item summary, jira web link (assume https://jira.lais.net/browse/)
> - For every PR link:
>   - use gh to get PR description
>   - note the name of the branch, it should be on the form WEB-xxxxx where the x is any digit (arity varies). Put the WEB-xxxxx string into a list
>   - parse list after Resolves header in the description
>   - for every item in list, extract string on the form WEB-xxxxx. Put into the same list if not already there.
> - Sort the list, construct Jira links, download markup, retrieve title/description, store summary + link.
> - Output: `Jira summary: Jira link`

## 2. Iterative Changes Implemented
| Step | Change | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Initial script created (`release-log.py`) | Implements end-to-end flow with env-based Jira auth and PR scanning. |
| 2 | Added hard‑coded Jira PAT constants | User requested assumption of hard-coded token. |
| 3 | Adjusted Jira auth logic to always prefer hard-coded PAT | Align with spec revision. |
| 4 | Fixed enterprise GitHub host usage (removed unsupported `--hostname` flag, rely on `GH_HOST`) | `gh pr view --hostname` unsupported in current gh version. |
| 5 | Added Basic→Bearer fallback for Jira API | Jira instance returned 401 for Basic; Bearer token works. |
| 6 | Refined tag selection to choose previous *series* tag (e.g. `v30.7.0-9` and `v30.7.0-8`) | Original logic picked two most recent globally, not previous in same series. |
| 7 | Added commit→PR mapping, always extracting issue keys from commit subjects | Ensure subjects always contribute keys. |
| 8 | Added reporting of unmapped commits (no WEB- key) | Visibility for commits lacking issue references (merge, tag, misc). |
| 9 | Added per-issue Jira summary retrieval with concurrency | Performance improvement; already part of initial but retained after refactors. |

## 3. Current Behavior Summary
- Detects latest tag and previous tag in same version series (numeric suffix pattern `<base>-<n>`).
- Lists all commits in `<previous_tag>.. <latest_tag>`.
- Extracts WEB issue keys from commit subjects (always) and PR data (branch name + Resolves section + fallback body scan).
- Fetches Jira summaries using Basic auth first; on HTTP 401 retries with Bearer token using the hard-coded PAT.
- Outputs sorted issue summaries.
- Appends a section listing commits with *no* associated WEB issue key (excluding the tag annotation commits themselves).

## 4. Key Code Sections (Final Version Excerpts)

### 4.1 Hard-Coded Jira PAT (Redacted)
```python
JIRA_HARDCODED_USER = "jira-bot-or-updated-user"
JIRA_HARDCODED_PAT = "<REDACTED_PAT>"  # Stored in script per request
```

### 4.2 Series-Aware Tag Selection
```python
def get_last_two_version_tags(limit: int = 30) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    tags_raw = git("tag", "--sort=-creatordate")
    tags = [t for t in tags_raw.splitlines() if VERSION_TAG_REGEX.match(t)]
    if not tags:
        raise SystemExit("No version tags found")
    latest = tags[0]
    series_re = re.compile(r'^(v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+)-(\d+)$')
    m = series_re.match(latest)
    if m:
        base = m.group(1)
        cur_num = int(m.group(2))
        best: Optional[Tuple[int, str]] = None
        for t in tags[1:]:
            m2 = series_re.match(t)
            if not m2 or m2.group(1) != base:
                continue
            num = int(m2.group(2))
            if num < cur_num and (not best or num > best[0]):
                best = (num, t)
        if best:
            return latest, best[1]
    if len(tags) < 2:
        raise SystemExit("Need at least two version tags")
    return latest, tags[1]
```

### 4.3 Jira Fetch with Basic→Bearer Fallback
```python
def jira_fetch_summary(issue: str, auth: Optional[Tuple[str, str]]) -> Optional[str]:
    url = JIRA_API_ISSUE.format(issue=issue)
    def parse(resp):
        data = json.loads(resp.read().decode())
        fields = data.get("fields") or {}
        summary = fields.get("summary")
        return summary.strip() if isinstance(summary, str) else None
    def open_with(auth_header: Optional[str]):
        req = urllib.request.Request(url)
        req.add_header("Accept", "application/json")
        if auth_header:
            req.add_header("Authorization", auth_header)
        return urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=20)
    if not auth:
        try:
            with open_with(None) as resp: return parse(resp)
        except urllib.error.HTTPError as e: return f"{issue} (HTTP {e.code})"
        except Exception: return None
    basic_header = "Basic " + base64.b64encode(f"{auth[0]}:{auth[1]}".encode()).decode()
    try:
        with open_with(basic_header) as resp: return parse(resp)
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
        if e.code == 401:
            bearer_header = f"Bearer {auth[1]}"
            try:
                with open_with(bearer_header) as resp2: return parse(resp2)
            except urllib.error.HTTPError as e2:
                return f"{issue} (HTTP {e2.code})"
            except Exception: return None
        return f"{issue} (HTTP {e.code})"
    except Exception:
        return None
```

### 4.4 Commit / PR Issue Key Aggregation + Unmapped Output
```python
# Per-commit subject keys always collected
for sha, subj in subjects.items():
    subj_keys = extract_issue_keys_from_text(subj)
    commit_issue_keys_map[sha] = set(subj_keys)
    issue_keys |= subj_keys
...
# After PR enrichment, compute unmapped commits
unmapped = []
for sha in commits:
    if subjects.get(sha) in {new_tag, old_tag}:  # skip tag annotation
        continue
    if not commit_issue_keys_map.get(sha):
        unmapped.append((sha, subjects.get(sha, '')))
if unmapped:
    print("\nUnmapped commits (no WEB- issue detected):")
    for sha, subj in unmapped:
        print(f"{sha[:10]} {subj}")
```

## 5. Sample Output (Current Run)
```
Using tags: older=v30.7.0-8 newer=v30.7.0-9
Found 18 PRs
<issue summaries ...>

Unmapped commits (no WEB- issue detected):
08fb1cb622 30.7.0-9
9b533e83da Merge branch 'develop' into release
a1b5b6fa8f Allow codesign to use cert
```

## 6. Usage Examples
```bash
# Standard run (auto-detect tags in same series)
python release-log.py

# Explicit tag range
python release-log.py --tags v30.7.0-8 v30.7.0-9

# Offline (no gh/Jira network calls, subject-based extraction only)
python release-log.py --offline

# Verbose diagnostics
GH_HOST=git.lais.net python release-log.py --verbose
```

## 7. Security Note
- A hard-coded Jira PAT is present in `release-log.py` by explicit request; this is generally unsafe.
- Recommended: move token to environment or secret manager and fall back only if env unset.
- PAT value redacted in this documentation.

## 8. Potential Future Enhancements
- Optional YAML / JSON output mode for downstream automation.
- Cache Jira issue summaries (simple shelve file) to reduce API calls in repeated runs.
- Configurable issue key regex (support multiple projects, e.g. `WEB|MOB` prefixes).
- Flag to fail (non-zero exit) if unmapped commits exist.
- Parallel PR fetch (currently sequential) for large ranges.

## 9. Interaction Log (Removal of Hard-Coded PAT)

### 2025-09-26 Change Summary
- Removed hard-coded Jira PAT constant (`JIRA_HARDCODED_PAT`).
- Replaced `JIRA_HARDCODED_USER` with `JIRA_DEFAULT_USER`.
- Added env-based auth: reads `.env` (PAT=...) or env vars `PAT` / `JIRA_PAT`; `JIRA_USER` overrides default.
- Updated docstring removing reference to embedded PAT.
- If no PAT present: performs unauthenticated Jira fetch; summaries show `(no auth)`.

### Diff Sketch
- Deleted: `JIRA_HARDCODED_PAT = "..."`
- Added: `JIRA_DEFAULT_USER = "LAFMOG"`
- Added env parsing block in main() before Jira fetch.
- Replaced remaining references to old constant.

### Rationale
Security cleanup; removes committed secret; aligns with standard secret injection via environment.

### Possible Follow-Ups
- Add `--format json` output.
- Add `--issue-prefixes WEB,MOB,...`.
- Warn (even non-verbose) when PAT missing.
- Parallelize PR fetch.

## 10. 2025-09-29 Resolves Parsing Fix

### Context

PR 7991 contained:

## Resolves

- WEB-35306 ...
- WEB-35309 ...

WEB-35309 was not collected.

### Root Cause

• extract_issue_keys_from_resolves stopped at the first blank line after the header (if l.strip() == "" or l.startswith('#'): break).
• Result: Entire bullet list skipped when a blank line follows the header.
• Regex \bWEB-\d+\b was not the issue in this case.

### Fix

Replaced loop (lines 227–232) to:

• Skip blank lines (continue) instead of breaking.
• Only break on next markdown header (^#).

### Patch

 while j < len(lines):
-    l = lines[j]
-    if l.strip() == "" or l.startswith('#'):
-        break
-    keys |= extract_issue_keys_from_text(l)
-    j += 1
+    l = lines[j]
+    stripped = l.strip()
+    if stripped.startswith('#'):
+        break  # next markdown header
+    if stripped == "":
+        j += 1
+        continue
+    keys |= extract_issue_keys_from_text(l)
+    j += 1

### Verification Snippet

body = """## Resolves

- WEB-35306
- WEB-35309
"""
print(extract_issue_keys_from_resolves(body))
# => {'WEB-35306', 'WEB-35309'}

### Impact

• All issue keys under “## Resolves” now captured even with a separating blank line.
• Prevents silent misses for common markdown formatting.

### Possible Follow-Ups

• Add unit tests around header + blank line + bullets pattern.
• Optional: also parse “Resolved” / “Fixes” aliases via expanded header regex.
